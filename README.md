# HTML Widget for Neos CMS

Administrators and everyone with the privilegde `CodeQ.HtmlWidget:WidgetDefinition` can create HTML Widget Definitions, including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We recommend to create a separate, hidden Widget Definiton page for that.

All editors can add those HTML Widgets as content.

## Features

*   Automatically blocks JavaScript code in the backend
*   Restricts editing of HTML widget definitions, while allowing editors to use those widgets

*The development and the public-releases of this package is generously sponsored [Code Q Web Factory](http://codeq.at).*

## Installation

CodeQ.HtmlWidget is available via packagist. `"codeq/htmlwidget" : "~1.0"` to the require section of the composer.json
or run:

```bash
composer require codeq/htmlwidget
```

We use semantic-versioning so every breaking change will increase the major-version number.
